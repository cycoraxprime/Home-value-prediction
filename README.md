# Home-value-prediction
Create a machine learning model to predict
home values. Preprocess housing data,
handling missing values and encoding
categorical variables. Select relevant features
and split data into training and testing sets.
Train regression algorithms like linear
regression or ensemble methods on the
training data. Optimize hyperparameters
using techniques like grid search or
randomized search. Evaluate model
performance using metrics like mean squared
error or R-squared. Fine-tune the model for
improved accuracy. Validate predictions on
unseen data. Provide documentation
detailing the model's architecture, training
process, and usage instructions.
